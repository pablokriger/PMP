Two of the answer choices represent activities, which are not associated with the Planning Process Group, and, as a result, those responses can be eliminated. Both of the remaining answer choices represent plausible actions that may have led to better stakeholder engagement. The actual PMP exam may present questions with more than one correct answer, and the PMP aspirant must select the 'best' answer among the potentially correct options. In this case, the development of the stakeholder engagement assessment matrix directly addresses the issue described by the question. The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is used as a tool during the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process and identifies key stakeholders along with their current and desired engagement level. Classifications for stakeholder engagement may include unaware, resistant, neutral, supportive, and leading. In this scenario, certain key stakeholders were resistant to the project, which caused the project to run behind schedule. A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is the best tool for identifying resistant stakeholders with enough influence to undermine a project. In this case, identifying the current and desired engagement levels of the key stakeholders might have allowed the project manager to take action to address the undesirable engagement levels and prevent the stakeholder's resistance from negatively impact the project's performance.

You have completed 40% of the work which is the earned value (EV), i.e., EV = 40% x $100,000 = $40,000. Understanding what exactly the question asks is the key to answering the question correctly. The last sentence of the question starts with \"How much more will it cost to complete the project...\", implying we are requested to find the estimate to complete (ETC). The ETC can be calculated as follows: ETC = EAC - AC, where the EAC is the estimate to complete. Selecting the correct formual for the EAC is another key to answering this question correctly. The last sentence ofthe question ends with \"...if the cost performance remains unchanged?\", implying that the formula for the EAC should consider the cost performance index (CPI), i.e.: EAC = BAC / CPI. The CPI, in turn, can be claculated using the following formula: CPI = EV / AC = 40,000 / 60,000 = 0.67. The rest of the calculations are shown below: EAC = 100,000 / 0.67 = 149,254. ETC = 149,254 - 60,000 = 89,254. Therefore, the cost to complete the renovation if the cost performance remains unchanged is $89,254.",

Burn charts are one way of visualizing the project's performance over time. Depending on the information that needs to be understood, different approaches can be used to build burn charts.

Release burn charts document the work completed for each iteration over the course of a release. Finally, product burn charts typically display the story points completed for each iteration over the course of the entire project. Burndown charts record the work remaining (usually in the form of story points) over time. Burnup charts show the work completed by the project team over time. Burnup charts are better for understanding team productivity than burndown charts as they document the work completed by the project team. Burndown charts can provide a distorted view of team productivity as an increase/decrease in project scope will affect the trendline independent of the work actually accomplished.

When agile methodologies are employed, the business analyst may also assist with the development and refinement of the product backlog. With scrum, the product owner is responsible for managing the product backlog and ensuring that it is prioritized according to business value.

Now, the actual development work is on the team. It is the development team that defines how the work will be performed or what approaches and the techniques will be followed in the development process.

The milestone list is an output from the Define Activities process to which the WBS serves as an input (as part of the scope baseline). The risk register is an output from the Identify Risks process to which the WBS serves as an input (as part of the scope baseline) used as a framework to structure risk identification techniques. Had the project manager and the team taken the time to create a proper WBS, it is likely the team would have had a more accurate milestone list and risk register with which to finish their project management plan on time and avoid the conflict described in the scenario.",

Technology support is among the considerations for tailoring that should be kept in mind while planning the project under the circumstances described in the scenario. The question presents a situation where a project is being conducted in a desolate area without any existing infrastructure for technology support. This circumstance means that there are no cellular towers or Wi-Fi and no readily available means of communication. Concerning controlling the schedule, the project manager must consider how the project management software, including the project schedule, will be updated and submitted daily to the home office. The project manager may need to acquire the necessary equipment to use satellite technology and reconsider the content and frequency of the project status updates. Therefore, of the available choices, technology support is the best answer to the question asked.",

Thus, the answer choices that relate to other project management processes can be eliminated as correct responses. With the project lasting at least seven years, the impact of inflation over the course of the project must be considered. Additionally, since the project is international in scope, the project will likely be working with various currencies that will be subject to fluctuations in relative values. For large-scale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the fluctuations of currencies and inflation need to be understood and built into the Estimate Costs process. Exchange rates and inflation are considered enterprise environmental factors. Therefore, of the available choices, considering additional enterprise environmental factors is the best response.",

Bid documents along with the request for proposal (RFP), procurement statement of work (SOW), source selection criteria, independent cost estimates are among the outputs of this process. These documents are also among the inputs to the Conduct Procurements process. However, not all of these documents are provided by the buyer to the prospective sellers. Sometimes, to benchmark procurements, the buying organization develops independent cost estimates either internally or using external resources such as a professional estimator. Buyers do not usually provide these estimates to the prospective sellers since a benchmark range may prejudice the sellers into proposing prices that do not work well with their business model and resources. The buyer uses these benchmark estimates principally to verify if bids are reasonable, or if a large number of outliers indicate an issue with procurement processes or communications. Thus, of the choices provided, leaving the independent cost estimates out of the bid package makes the most sense and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.",

    "explanation": "To properly close a project phase or project, appropriate stakeholders sign off that work has been delivered. Techniques in agile project management methodologies such as \"definition of done\" and \"demonstrations\" can also be applied in a plan-driven project. This approach helps ensure that stakeholders agree at the start of the project that the work is not only completed, but a shared understanding of done and the criteria to accept the work are exactly defined. Demonstrations serve as checkpoints throughout the project to demonstrate product increments to the relevant stakeholders, get feedback, and adjust as needed. By utilizing those two agile practices, project teams can better determine whether or not the project or phase can be successfully closed.",

One of the tools and techniques associated with this process is an inspection. The inspection includes activities such as measuring, examining, and validating to determine whether the work and deliverables meet requirements and product acceptance criteria. A product review is an example of an inspection. In this scenario, the client performed a test which exposed a software bug and caused a deliverable to be rejected. Unless stated otherwise in the question text, deliverables are always placed under configuration control. Therefore, submitting a change request to fix the deliverable is what you should do.",

Monitor Stakeholder Engagement is the process of monitoring stakeholder relationships and tailoring strategies for engaging stakeholders through the modification of engagement strategies and plans. This process helps maintain or increase the efficiency and effectiveness of stakeholder engagement activities as the project evolves and its environment changes. The Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process belongs to the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group, while according to the scenario, the project manager is carrying out the Manage Project knowledge process, which is part of the Executing Process Group. Monitoring stakeholder engagement does not help identify the people or processes needed to establish a knowledge management system for the project, whereas the other options, namely the lessons learned register, the resource breakdown structure, and project team assignments are useful in determining what is required for a knowledge management system.

A resource calendar identifies the working days, shifts, start and end of normal business hours, weekends, and public holidays when each specific resource is available. Information on which resources are potentially available during a planned activity period is used for estimating resource utilization. Resource calendars also specify when and for how long the identified team and physical resources will be available during the project. Of the available choices, looking at the resource calendars provides the best source of information for the project manager about the availability of the team members to perform project work. Note, resource calendars are progressively elaborated and updated throughout the project.

Even though you, as the project manager, are skeptical that the approach will be effective, you should still support the project team with their efforts to improve productivity. After all, the purpose of a sprint retrospective is for the project team to inspect and adapt their practices in order to improve performance. Additionally, the team members are the experts with the development work and are in a better position to determine how they can best work together compared to a project manager. After the practice has been implemented, it will be incumbent on the project manager to verify any performance improvements and bring that information to the project team during the next sprint retrospective so the team can further reflect and adjust. A burndown chart will capture the team's velocity and allow a before and after comparison to determine whether or not pair programming was successful in improving productivity. Any knowledge gained should then be captured in the lessons learned register. Note, the scenario implies the project is managed using hybrid methods. Therefore, incorporating pair programming may or may not require an approved change request. This would depend on how explicit the project management plan is in this case.",

    "explanation": "The scenario describes a hybrid project that incorporates agile practices into a predictive project management framework. A developer raises an impediment during a daily standup meeting. Even though this issue represents a blocker for a particular developer and may result in a schedule delay, it might not be an impediment for the entire project team. Agile teams emphasize the use of generalizing specialists. Thus, it is possible that other team members might be able to assist in resolving this issue. The project team is responsible for producing the deliverables, collaborating on achieving the project's objectives. Swarming is a technique that is typically used when agile practices are incorporated into a project. With this technique, multiple team members focus collectively on resolving a specific impediment. Note, when all of the team members leave their current tasks to help one developer, it is reasonable to assume that their tasks may also be delayed. While this assumption makes the correct answer arguable, of the choices provided, suggesting swarming is the project manager's best course of action.",

One best practice for the team charter is to limit the working agreements to the top five to ten items.

Therefore, it would be appropriate to ask the project team for their top five to ten agreements and then capture them in the form of a team charter.

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Proper attention to the Implement Risk Responses process will ensure that the agreed-upon risk responses are actually executed. A common problem with Project Risk Management is that project teams spend effort in identifying and analyzing risks and developing risk responses, then risk responses are agreed upon and documented in the risk register and risk report, but no action is taken to manage the risk. The incorrect answer choices all represent activities that occurred during project planning, which according to the scenario, was meticulous and followed all project management best practices. Therefore, the most likely reason for the project failing to meet objectives is the result of inadequate attention to the Implement Risk Responses process during project execution. Thus, among the available choices, taking little or no action to manage the known risks is the best answer to the question asked.",

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Risk audits are among the tools and techniques of the Monitor Risks process. Risk audits are used to consider the effectiveness of the risk management process. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency as defined in the project's risk management plan. Risk audits are typically performed by the project team and may be included during routine project review meetings or may form part of a risk review meeting, or the team may choose to hold separate risk audit meetings. In this scenario, since conducting risk audits internally is not contrary to project management best practices, and the current risk audit process has proven to be effective, there is no reason to agree with the executive. Therefore, among the available options, the best course of action is to explain to the executive that risk audits can be performed either internally or externally as long as they follow the project management plan. Note that any stakeholder can request a change to the project. It is not clear from the question if the executive's comment constitutes a change request. If, after explaining the rationale for continuing with the current internal risk audits, the executive still wants external auditors performing the risk audits, the project manager should follow the change control process established for the project. However, in this situation, the change request would likely be rejected since there is no reason to believe that the project would benefit from hiring external auditors to perform the risk audits.",

    "explanation": "In this scenario, the project team is deciding between two different risk responses for inclusion in the risk register, which suggests that the project team is currently performing the Plan Risk Responses process. Alternatives analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and multicriteria decision analysis are all techniques which are commonly used during the Plan Risk Responses process to select risk responses. Note, the question is asking for the action that the project team is 'least' likely to take in selecting the risk response. A Monte Carlo simulation is a data analysis technique where a computer model is iterated many times, with the input values chosen at random for each iteration driven by the input data, including probability distributions and probabilistic branches. Outputs are generated to represent the range of possible outcomes for the project. However, in this case, there are only two options under consideration which can serve as inputs for the simulation. Thus, a Monte Carlo simulation would only be able to perform two unique iterations rather than the many iterations required to produce a probability distribution. Using a Monte Carlo simulation is not appropriate when only a small, finite number of options are under consideration. Since there are only two options under consideration, in this case, a Monte Carlo simulation is not the appropriate tool for the project team to use in selecting the best risk response.",

For example, there may have been a good reason the client did not want this added functionality. Perhaps the client's computer system cannot support more advanced functionality. Additionally, the added code may interfere with other functionality since it was not integrated with the original build plan. Of the available choices, the best course of action is to remove the added functionality and ensure that the design plan is followed in the future. Note that if the project manager believes that this added functionality would benefit the customer, then the suggestion can be made to the customer. The customer can then decide whether or not to add the functionality and accept any impact on other project constraints.

A work package can be used to group the activities where work is scheduled and estimated, monitored, and controlled. In the context of the WBS, work refers to work products or deliverables that are the result of activity and not to the activity itself. The work packages are further decomposed into schedule activities that are then sequenced to obtain the greatest efficiency given all the project's constraints.
